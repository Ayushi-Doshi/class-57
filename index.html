        <p>I like Writing poems as it makes me think more and get different ideas.i write poem specially whenever their is birthday or any anniversary in family or of a friend. Its not hard for me to write poems as istart writing poem the words come in my mind automatically .But i cant sit at place and write poems i may doing some other work and at that time i get lines to write and those lines never stop .the poems i write may be more than 6 to 8 lines. i write ryming lines and poem is made. </p>
